# 2048 Game with React

Welcome to the 2048 Game built with React! This project allows you to enjoy the classic 2048 puzzle game right in your web browser. Here's how to get started with the game and understand the available scripts.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. It provides a simple and efficient way to create React applications.

To begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. To start the game, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will automatically reload if you make any edits to the source code. If there are any lint errors, you will see them in the console.

### `yarn test`

This script launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. If you want to learn more about running tests, please refer to the documentation.

### `yarn build`

This script builds the app for production. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The result will be placed in the `build` folder.

The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you have the option to eject at any time. This will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Ejecting copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) directly into your project. You will have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work but will point to the copied scripts for your customizations.

**Note:** You don't have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for most small and middle-sized deployments. You can customize your setup as needed when you're ready.
